## About project

This is a simple implementation of the popular game "2048". You can see the result at [link](https://yastrebdev.github.io/2048/)

#### Development plans

- [ ] Create a "Play" button
- [ ] Implement saving the result of the current game in the local storage, so that when you reload the browser you can continue the game
- [ ] Output the current score, save the number of points after the first game

## Working with the archive

The architecture of the application is simple and is run from a single html file through a local server. If you use VS Code, use the "**Go Live**" function
